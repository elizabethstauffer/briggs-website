        <p>Sarah Grace McLaughlin was born in London to parents from Bishopbriggs,
          Scotland which inspired her professional name. At age four, she moved to
          Tokyo with her family. She sang in public for the first time at a Tokyo
          karaoke bar, and immediately realized she wanted to continue performing
          throughout her life.</p><br>
        <p>Growing up with the city's karaoke bar traditions and hearing music ranging
          from Motown musicians to The Beatles at home also influenced her to pursue
          music. She started writing her own songs at age seven, which she would
          perform for her family. She moved to Hong Kong at age 10, where she had her
          formative years and lived until she was 18. After graduating from Hong Kong
          International School she moved to Los Angeles, California, and attended
          college at Musician's Institute.</p></br>
